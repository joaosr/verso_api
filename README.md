## Data structures diagram

Based on the task description, I'm considering that an Order has a quantity of the same product from one supplier.â€¨

For simplicity, I'm keeping the supplier name as an attribute in the Order table, and an Order can have many items (quantity attribute) of the same product.

### Improvements
There are two changes that I can see as potential improvements, but are out of the escope of the task:

- Allow an Order to contain different products
- Move supplier to a separete table connected with Product table
